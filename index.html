      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I decided to research a mystery: what happens to all of the University of Texas at Austin's waste?
        I investigated my question by talking to people in charge of <a hef="http://www.facilitiesservices.utexas.edu/zerowaste">UT's resource recovery and zero waste</a> initiatives.
        From my conversations, I was able to literally follow the recycling from campus (image 1) to the recycling plant (images 2 and 3).

      <p>One of the biggest things I learned from my research was that the UT community only sorts about 70% of its waste correctly.
        In other words, 30% of what is recycled is actually trash and 30% of what is thrown into the trash can is actually recycling.
      </p>
      <p>In an effort to improve the recycling efficiency, I created this basic trash/recycling sorting game that uses <a href="p5js.org">p5.js</a> and images from <a href="https://github.com/garythung/trashnet">trashnet</a>.
        This project is hosted by GitHub Pages and the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/wkuglen/trash-sorter-game">on GitHub</a>
